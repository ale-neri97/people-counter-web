# People Counter on ToF
## Description
On this repo you will find the source code of the website of a semester project where we made a People Counter using a TI ToF Camera and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to filter amplitude and phases sequences, recognize, and track people to store and display the count of people in scene in the livestream and the ones who have already passed.
